# HotNCold
**HotNCold** is a **Minecraft Plugin** that will add a new mechanic to the game: **temperature**. In doing so it introduces new **threats**, new **bonuses** and more to be careful at, in order to survive. As you might imagine, the plugin is suggested for **survival** gamemodes (Vanilla, Survival) and **roleplays**, but, thanks to its **incredible configurability**, it can be used anywhere.

Check out [the Wiki](https://github.com/Fulminazzo/HotNCold/wiki) for more information.
